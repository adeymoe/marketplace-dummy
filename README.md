# MARKETPLACE E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
Marketplace is an innovative e-commerce platform designed to seamlessly connect buyers and sellers while ensuring security and trust. Sellers can easily upload their products, and buyers can effortlessly browse and request purchases. The platform acts as a secure intermediary, facilitating smooth transactions by managing payments and ensuring safe delivery of products from sellers to buyers, providing peace of mind for all parties involved.
